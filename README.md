# 3-style
Program to learn and practice the 3-style method for solving a rubik's cube blindfolded

I'm just learning to program, I just learned how to use Git and Github today, figured it could be good to have a project to work on while I learn to program (currently doing The Odin Project)

I know a little bit of 3-style, but I would like to learn it and get good at 3BLD (current PB: 3DNFs in comp haha), and the resources for 3-style aren't as fleshed out as I would like them, so I am going to do it myself I guess.

* Set Up

Went to cubing.js [link], will use it to do 3D visualizations of the 3 style algs to learn more intuitively

Downloaded Node

and installed the libraries using
npm install cubing
